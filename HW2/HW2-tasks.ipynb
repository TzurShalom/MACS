        "1. Implement Caesar's cipher: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher, both the encoder and the decoder. Your encoder should use a right shift of 11. Your implementation should deal with both uppercase and lowercase characters. For example - `A` should be encoded as `L`, and `a` should be encoded as `l`. Non-alphabetic characters should stay as they are.\n",

        "  * Decode the result of encoding and print the decoded string.\n",
        "  * Compare the original and recovered texts - they should be the same.\n",
        "3. For what _n_, where _n_ is the shift size, both the encoder and the decoder would output the same resulting string for every given input string? In other words, find an _n_ such that for each _x_ we would get: (_x_ + _n_) mod 26 = (_x_ - _n_) mod 26.\n",
        "4. Implement the Vigenère cipher: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigenère_cipher, both the encoder and the decoder. Use the keyword `XYZZY`. As before, your implementation should preserve capitalization and keep non-alphabetic characters as they are. For example - the string `Hey, you!` should be encoded using the pairs `(H, X), (e, y), (y, z), (y, z), (o, y), (u, x)`, resulting with the cipher `Ecx, xmr!`.\n",
